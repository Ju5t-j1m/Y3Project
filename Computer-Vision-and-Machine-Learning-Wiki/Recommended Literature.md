# Recommended Literature

This page contains a list academic papers and literature pertaining to machine learning research that should be considered **required reading** for all students starting ML projects.

## Online resources

Resources available online which reference to freely available literature. 

- [9 Seminal Deep Learning Papers](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/The-9-Deep-Learning-Papers-You-Need-To-Know-About.html)

  Seminal works on CNN development with a focus on image classification, segmentation, and object localization. These are the core methods that newer state-of-the-art methods all build off of. **Read all of these.**

- [Alexander Jung's repository of paper summaries](https://github.com/aleju/papers)

  A researcher has been compiling a github repository of summaries of the literature they read. Consistent formatting, accurate and meaningful summaries, sensible curation of the reported results and figures. 

  - As an example here is a [summary of the Wide Residual Networks Paper (2016)](https://github.com/aleju/papers/blob/master/neural-nets/Wide_Residual_Networks.md). 

  - The intention here is NOT to avoid reading the described paper, but to introduce yourself to the concepts at play to preempt the terseness of the full paper.

- [Deep Learning Field Roadmap](https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap)

  Cited chronology of highly influential papers in different sub-fields with download links to pdf's.

- [Good Review Paper](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf)

  A review of the field written by leading scientists in the field Yann Lecun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton. 



## Books

Free to download as `.pdf` files. Incredibly important resources for understanding the theory and the problem domain. You cannot develop a solution to a problem you don't understand.

Foundation in core techniques and fundamental mathematics for machine learning. Start here:
- [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book - Burkov](http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php)
- [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares - Boyd and Vandenberghe](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/)

More advanced books by leading researchers, offering a deeper look at the theory of machine learning:
- [Deep Learning - Goodfellow](https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf)
- [Machine Learning - Bishop](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning - Hastie](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)
