### Academic Torrents - A Distributed Dataset Collection

**http://academictorrents.com/**

Hosting and distributing large datasets is cumbersome and expensive in storage and bandwidth costs. The torrent protocol for file transfer (while unfortunately synonymous with internet piracy and theft) actually offers a perfect solution to the problem of hosting and allowing access to extremely large datasets.

Once you have downloaded a dataset if you have the means and capacity you should seed for a reasonable amount of time to allow others to benefit from your having downloaded the data. 

#### Here are just a couple of the interesting datasets hosted there for download.

| Dataset                                   | Description                                                  | Link                                                         |

### Toy Image Datasets

Small scale image datasets useful for prototyping and experimentation. Datasets are small enough to fit in RAM without causing issues, even on small formfactor embedded and mobile devices, and on low power laptops. Useful for small scale image synthesis and classification.

| Dataset                | Description                                                  | Link                                             |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |

| notMNIST               | Labeled `28x28` grayscale images of letters in the range `A-J` from `10` classes sampled from publicly available fonts. | http://yaroslavvb.com/upload/notMNIST/           |
| Fashion MNIST          | Labelled `28x28` grayscale images of clothing items.         | https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist |
| CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 | `60,000` labelled `32x32` RGB images from `10` or `100` classes, respectively. | https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html      |

### Image Datasets

Larger scale image datasets which are too big to fit in RAM. Loading data efficiently during training and inference will be vital when working with these. Useful for image synthesis, classification, and segmentation.

| Dataset    | Description                                                  | Link                                             |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| SVHN       | `~600,000` labelled `32x32` RGB images of Google Street View House Numbers. | http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/          |
| ImageNet   | `~14 million` labelled RGB images with an average resolution of `469x387` from `1000` classes. [Human readable class names](https://gist.github.com/JossWhittle/005511f3b77a018b5381dd5c2f6b9a5b). | http://www.image-net.org/                        |
| Cityscapes | High resolution RGB images of drivers point of view within `50` different cities. `5000` images with fine segmentation masks, `20,000` with coarse segmentation masks. | https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/              |
